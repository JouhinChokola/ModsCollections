# Mod Collections
This is where I put my mod collections
I will put mods that can **Improve** performance for Minecraft 1.16.x, 1.19.x, and 1.20.x.
I've tested them and they increase my fps quite well.

Some `Vanilla Plus` and `Client Side` mods are also included in the list but I will be adding them soon when I feel like enough to put in.
Take a look below this! Thank you.
**THIS IS THE ENGLISH VERSION**

> [!NOTE]
> I referenced [UsefulMods](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods/tree/main) to made this list !!!
